OTP Manager accesses your device's camera (video stream only, no microphone) in order to scan QR codes.

OTP Manager stores information you enter, either manually or via QR code, in the device's internal memory. Other than by scanning QR codes the app generated, information enetred in OTP Manager does not leave the device.

OTP Manager encrypts OTP secrets with a user account specific password when storing them in the device's persistent storage. While this makes it difficult to access them without knowing the device's password, a sufficiently determined attacker will be able to do so. It also means that files created on one device by OTP manager will not work on another device: to safely transfer account information, it is necessary to scan a QR code generated by the app or manually enter the secret for a given account.
