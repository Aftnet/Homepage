QRafty accesses your device's camera (video stream only, no microphone) in order to scan QR codes.

Data read from a given QR code is retained until the application quits or until a different QR code is scanned.
This being said, QRafty does launch other applications as needed in response to scanned QR codes (opening the system's default browser when scanning a QR encoded web link for example). Such third party applications may store or transmit data they gather this way.

QRafty generates QR codes based on either information you enter manually or, in the case of contacts, from contact information you explicitly select from Windows 10's contacts store (QRafty never gains access to your entire contacts list). The information is retained only as long as needed to generate and display the QR code encoding it.

You have the option of exporting generated QR codes to file should you wish to keep a copy of the generated QR code. QRafty does not otherwise store records of generated QR codes or the information needed to generate them.

Apart from data encoded in generated QR codes that you scan with other devices, QRafty does not transmit data to remote systems.
