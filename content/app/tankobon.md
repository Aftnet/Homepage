Keep up with your favorite manga from your PC, tablet or smartphone! For your favorite series, Tankobon tracks what chapters you've read and periodically checks and notifies you of new ones.

Tankobon is a Universal App and is designed to look consistent with Windows 10's native media apps. It uses your chosen accent color throughout the UI and has a transparent tile to look good on Windows mobile 10's home screen.

Tankobon respects your privacy: the app doesn't display ads and doesn't track you in any way.
